Set up Open Graph and structured data


Deployment & CI/CD

Set up Vercel deployment
Configure environment variables
Implement CI/CD pipeline
Set up monitoring and error tracking



Detailed Implementation Order:

Start with Core Infrastructure: Begin with database connections and models as they form the foundation of your application.
Build Inside-Out: Start with server-side logic, then API routes, then UI components.
Implement Features Vertically: For each major feature (skateparks, shop, profiles, admin), implement the full stack (model → API → UI) before moving to the next feature.
Prioritize Critical Path: Focus first on the user-facing features that generate the most value or traffic.
Incremental Migration: You can deploy a partially migrated app, routing certain paths to your new Next.js app while keeping others on the old system temporarily.
